# Trackful 

A snappy, easy-to-use Time Tracker coded with React, Firebase, and Framer-Motion. Note; for this project to work, you will need to create an `.env` file
and supply it with your own API from Firebase. For this project, one of the challenges was getting the app to run in the background on mobile. 
For earlier attempts, I tried to increment the counter manually every second, which of course, doesn't work in the background.

## The Method

For the tracking method, there are 3 time snapshots which I compare, all using the `Date.now()` method. 

1. The initial time the tracker was created
2. The time that the 'play' button was pressed
3. The current time

To keep track, Trackful keeps the 3rd variable as a base, and then checks for differences every second between the 1st and 2nd, adding them together.
This way, the app still works even if you close it. The active state of the timer is also stored in Firebase.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
